# Portfolio Project: Mixed Messages

## Project Goals
For this project, I was tasked to build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. 

## Description
This JavaScript code generates a random daily fortune and advice. It randomly selects a day, a fortune, and an action from predefined lists and logs a message to the console in the format: **"On [day], you will [fortune]. Therefore, you should [action]."** This provides a simple, fun daily prediction for the user.

## Project Objectives
1. Build a message generator program using JavaScript
2. Use Git version control
3. Use command line
4. Develop locally on your computer

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using node:

```
$ cd ../folder
$ node script.js
```
